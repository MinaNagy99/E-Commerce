Welcome to our e-commerce project using HTML, CSS, JS, React, and Context!

This project is designed to showcase how to build an e-commerce website using the latest front-end technologies. We have used HTML and CSS for page layout and styling, JavaScript for dynamic functionality, React for building reusable components, and Context for state management.

To get started with the project, you will need to have Node.js and Git installed on your computer. Once you have those installed, you can clone the repository and run the following command to install the project dependencies:

Copy
npm install
After the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running the following command:

Copy
npm start
This will start the development server and open the website in your default browser. You can make changes to the code and see the changes live in the browser.

The project has several components that work together to create a fully functional e-commerce website. Some of the key features include:

Product listings: You can see a list of products with their prices, descriptions, and images.

Product details: You can click on a product to see more details and add it to your cart.

Cart: You can add products to your cart, remove products from your cart, and see the total cost.

Checkout: You can enter your shipping and payment information and complete your purchase.

The project uses Context for state management, which allows us to share data between components without having to pass it down through props. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to read.

We have also used React for building reusable components, which allows us to write less code and make changes more easily. For example, we have a Product component that can be used to display any product, regardless of its details.

Overall, our e-commerce project is a great example of how to build a modern website using the latest front-end technologies. We hope you find it useful and informative, and we welcome any feedback or contributions!
